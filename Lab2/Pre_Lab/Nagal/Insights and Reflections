Chapter 5 introduces students to essential programming concepts, including lists, functions, and dictionaries.

Lists
Lists are sequences of data values that allow programmers to manipulate data in various ways. 
The chapter begins by teaching the basics of lists, such as how to insert and remove elements, sort lists, and tailor them to specific needs. 
Additionally, it explores advanced concepts like mutator methods, aliases, object identity, structural equivalence, and tuples, all of which 
provide different techniques for working with lists effectively.

Functions
The second part of the chapter focuses on functions, which help programmers organize code more efficiently. 
Functions use parameters and arguments to define their objectives and include return statements that specify their exit points. 
This section also covers Boolean functions, which return either True or False based on the input provided. 
Moreover, it discusses main functions, which serve as the entry point of a program, offering a structured way to begin code execution.

Dictionaries
The final section introduces dictionaries, a powerful tool for organizing information through associations. 
Dictionaries in Python are structured as key-value pairs, written in the format {key: value}. 

For example, {"Name": "Migs", "Age": 20} represents a dictionary where the keys are "Name" and "Age," and their corresponding values are "Migs" and 20. 
This section explains how to access dictionary values, remove keys, traverse dictionaries, add new keys, 
replace existing values, and manipulate dictionaries to meet specific programming requirements.
