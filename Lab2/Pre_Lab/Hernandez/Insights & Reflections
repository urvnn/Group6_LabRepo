Chapter 4 highlights the manipulation of text, a fundamental aspect of computation, by exploring strings, text files, and their relationship with number systems.

Strings
Strings are among the most versatile data structures in Python, capable of handling a wide range of text-based operations. This part of the chapter delves deeper into 
string manipulation, covering how to access individual characters, retrieve substrings, and search within strings. The inclusion of data encryption, such as the Caesar
cipher, introduces practical methods for securing sensitive information, reinforcing the importance of data privacy. Additionally, the wide array of built-in string 
methods in Python simplifies text processing tasks, enhancing programming efficiency and flexibility.

Number Systems and Strings
Number systems, closely tied to strings, offer insight into how computers represent and process numerical data. The chapter explains binary, octal, decimal, and 
hexadecimal systems, focusing on their use in computation. Through exercises in base conversion and positional value, students gain a clear understanding of how 
numbers are stored and manipulated in a digital context. These skills are invaluable for working with encoding systems, optimizing data storage, and debugging at a 
low level.

Text Files
Text files are introduced as a practical way to store and retrieve data persistently. By learning file input/output operations, such as reading and writing strings 
and numbers, students can expand their programs to interact with external files. This capability bridges the gap between temporary data stored in memory and permanent 
data stored on disk. Combining file handling with string manipulation opens doors to applications such as logging, configuration management, and processing large 
datasets efficiently.
