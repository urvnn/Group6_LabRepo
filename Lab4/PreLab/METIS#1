Python Projects(Laura Cassell, Alan Gauld Edition 1): 

A console-based version (pp. 162-173) and a graphical user interface (GUI) version (pp. 186-193) of the Tic Tac Toe application development process are dealt with in the readings from Chapter 4 of Python Projects by Laura Cassell and 
Alan Gauld. These parts discuss important concepts like using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design to structure programs using Tkinter to create user interfaces. To improve clarity, maintainability, and scalability, the console-based 
application separates input/output from game logic, prioritizing modular design. By introducing event-driven programming and demonstrating how Tkinter's widgets and event handlers can smoothly connect user interactions to underlying logic, 
the GUI version expands on this foundation. The subtle application of the MVC pattern shows how important it is to keep data, interface, and logic separate for a strong application architecture. When considering this process, the transition 
from a console application to a graphical user interface (GUI) app shows flexibility and preparation, demonstrating the repetitive nature of development. Making the switch from procedural to event-driven programming is a great learning 
experience since it emphasizes the mentality change needed to create dynamic apps. In the conclusion, these readings highlight how Python can be used for both backend logic and UI development.
