This chapter of the book primarily focuses on use case driven development. Specifically, Use case
Diagrams, and action diagrams where we will be focusing on the Use case Diagrams.  

Use Case Diagrams 

Use-case diagrams are visual tools in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that represent the 
interactions between users (actors) and a system to define its functional requirements. These 
diagrams provide a high-level overview of how a system operates by illustrating the various use 
cases (specific actions or functionalities) and the actors involved. Key components of a use-case 
diagram include actors, use cases, system boundaries, and relationships such as associations, 
includes, and extensions. For instance, in an online shopping system, actors like customers and 
payment systems interact with use cases such as browsing products, making payments, and generating 
invoices. Similarly, in an ATM system, customers and the bank system collaborate to perform 
functions like withdrawing cash, checking balances, and depositing funds. 

The importance of use-case diagrams lies in their ability to clarify system requirements and 
improve communication among stakeholders. By offering a visual representation, they simplify 
complex processes and ensure all parties understand the system's functionality and scope. They 
also help in identifying critical features and prioritizing development efforts, making them 
valuable in design and implementation. Furthermore, these diagrams support testing by providing 
a framework to verify whether the system meets its requirements. By fostering collaboration and 
understanding, use-case diagrams are essential tools in software development, ensuring systems 
are built to meet user needs effectively.
